### Summary of assignment:
#### The aim is to create a java application using Java Graphics showcasing three different fractals: 
#### - Mandelbrot set
#### - Phoenix set
#### - Pythagoras tree
### This project utilizes OOP concepts as well as mathematical methods for the different fractals and allows for customization as well as advanced exploration of the fractals. Alongside the three different fractals, available in the Fractals menu bar, the following settings are also available:
#### - Zoom into set fractals with mouse clicks
#### - Resizing and changing angles of the tree
#### - Recoloring of set elements and surrounding colors
#### - Recoloring of the background and tree elements, with implemented transparency for overlapping elements
#### - Saving the settings for all fractals (TBI)
### Underneath you may find highlights of these functioanalities:
